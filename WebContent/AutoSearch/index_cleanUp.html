Welcome to the very unpolished WICK testing ground.
A view source on this document should give you most information you need
to make WICK work on your site, as i'm still working on more formal documentation
that'll also include integration suggestions to make this work as fast as possible with
large amounts of data.
<br/><br/>
Be sure to enter multiple e-mail addresses in each field, type a few characters, hit the delete key,
use your keyboard's up and down arrows, hit return or tab to select an item, use your mouse to hover and click,
deleting from a current item back into the preceding item, and basically poke around mercilessly.

<div id="wickStatus">
Loading ... please hold!
</div>

<form onsubmit="return checkForm()"> <!-- WICK STEP 5: this prevents form from being submitted right-away if a user hits RETURN to select an address -->
My First Box:<br />
<input class="wickEnabled" type="text" size="50" /><br />

document.getElementById("wickStatus").innerHTML = '<a target="_blank" href="./sample_data.js">Loaded <b>' + collection.length + '</b> Sample Addresses</a>';
